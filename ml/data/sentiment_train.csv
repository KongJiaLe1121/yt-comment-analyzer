"Judgement Day “But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered in his presence, and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left. “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home. I was naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’ “Then these righteous ones will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing? When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ “And the King will say, ‘I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me!’ “Then the King will turn to those on the left and say, ‘Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons. For I was hungry, and you didn’t feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me a drink. I was a stranger, and you didn’t invite me into your home. I was naked, and you didn’t give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’ “Then they will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?’ “And he will answer, ‘I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.’ “And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life.” Matthew 25:31‭-‬46 NLT",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

Ok so I’ve watched it excepting something bad as are all of Disney’s live actions and I was surprised as how worse it even managed to be than publicized. How on earth was this produced? Rachel Zegler is an incredibly talented singer but she has no charisma here and most certainly not the looks of the fairest of anything poor thing. What a miscast. The woke philosophy behind her casting could have been tolerable had she been right for the part but she just doesn’t have the looks. I understand that she was named Snow White because of being born on a snowy day and not because of her complexion event though that’s total betrayal to the original tale but there’s no way to make her possibly pass as “the fairest of them all” and certainly not fairer than Gal Gadot who once more shows how stiff and limited her acting skills are. The whole thing has zero soul and even less charisma. Zegler was great in West Side Story but again she doesn’t have the charisma or the looks of a movie star. What an embarrassing waste of budget. The animals and most importantly the dwarfs have no presence and the fact that they used an actual human dwarf to play one of Johnathan’s companions is even more mind boggling. The songs are endlessly generic and nothing stands out. It’s so bad. A pity considering how much this must have cost.,negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

"Avoid! What a monumental disappointment this new adaptation of ""Snow White"" is! Supposedly modern, the film is in reality nothing more than a confused collection of poorly digested ideas. The script, wanting at all costs to correct the tales of the past, falls into the trap of hyper-correction and empties the story of all its poetry and magic. The casting choices, especially for the Queen, cruelly lack the presence and credibility necessary to embody the ""fairest of them all."" The new songs are completely forgettable and break the rhythm of the story instead of enriching it. The visual effects, at times, are painful to watch and sadly recall a low-cost television series. It is a soulless, charmless version that betrays the spirit of the original tale without offering anything worthwhile in exchange. An hour and a half completely wasted.",negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

"1 year old already! Didn’t seem necessary to make a follow-up but I actually found this one more enjoyable because it builds more of the world Maleficent inhabits, the mythology is much bigger than we thought better action scenes, too and the costume designs are spectacular the choice Maleficent faces here is sticking to protecting those like her or holding onto her humanity with Aurora it's all about aggressive action versus pacifism, uniting a kingdom based on politics vs love, and whether or not wiping out the enemy is best for ruling an entire people there's even a Biblical element towards the end that may feel like a cop-out for most viewers but it comes full circle considering the fairies' rich history if you didn't get enough from that previous movie then this one does try to step it up a bit more",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"I kinda feel disappointed with this. Many lost their lives to the war, and a lot of things to consider and then Maleficent just turned away with that in an instant and then boom, happy ending. Not to mention the Kingdom massacred the fairies, lock them up in a cathedral as they disappear one by one and then we just got a lighthearted ending. It’s more favorable to me if yes, let’s say Maleficent forgave them (in the blink of an eye lol) but she realized that because of that, humans and fairies can’t really co-exist and she part ways with Aurora for eternity. Idk, because of the plot structure, this should have at least an ending similar to this.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"One of my biggest issues with this remake is the weak plot. They had such a huge opportunity to reimagine Snow White for the modern era—especially in a world shaped by filters, cosmetic pressure, and social media. Vanity is already a central theme with the Evil Queen, and they could’ve turned that into a meaningful message about self-worth and identity especially for new young viewers. And Snow White’s original message—like the line “you can fill the world with sunshine”—is more relevant than ever in today’s world full of hate. They really missed a chance to say something powerful.",negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

"Angelina Jolie admitted that she still has the pair of horns at home. Angelina Jolie herself picked Lana Del Rey to sing Sleeping Beauty (1959)'s ""Once Upon a Dream"" for the end credits. Maleficent's magic changes colour. When she is good, her magic is gold and when she is evil, her magic is green. Diaval's make-up (in human form) consisted of ""crow's feet"" on his face and body All the actors and actresses in Maleficent were partly chosen to be in the movie based on their uncanny resemblances and/or likeness to their respective character counterparts in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959). For Maleficent's horns, Angelina Jolie wore several headpieces with different weights. One headpiece was so heavy that Angelina would have neck pains right after and therefore was not appropriate for her more physically intensive scenes, such as her flight and battle scenes. Maleficent is a fairy but notably resembles more of a harpy, the hybrid, winged creature from the Greek and Roman mythologies with the parts of a woman and a bird. The last major film of special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. After this film, he retired from the industry in 2015 due to lack of good work. Maleficent's prosthetics and make-up were inspired by singer Lady Gaga, particularly on her ""Born This Way"" album cover. Angelina Jolie's Disney debut. The film's cast includes one Oscar winner: Angelina Jolie; and two Oscar nominees: Imelda Staunton and Lesley Manville. Pax Jolie-Pitt, Zahara Jolie-Pitt: Angelina Jolie's children appear briefly, cowering in fear of Maleficent during the christening scene. The name ""Maleficent"" is derived from Latin and literally means ""evil doer"". There is no reason given in the film for Maleficent, as a young, good fairy, to have such a name.
