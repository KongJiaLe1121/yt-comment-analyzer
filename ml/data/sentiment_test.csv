"Are Disney in a woke-war against men? After this film i'm not longer in doubt. I just saw the sequel to ""Maleficent"" with Angelina Jolie. In fact, a Disney movie coined for children. No man has a role of significance in the film. The men who are there must find themselves playing supporting roles; weak, worthless or unconscious (literally, the king lies in a coma through most of the film). Women are the strongest forces, on both sides. The Queen, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, spins a plot so viciously that I think no man could make it up. But who executes her orders? Armies of men. I don't think we'll see an army of women led by a man. But the opposite is obviously not only accepted, but desirable. Also this message is clear; men get to find themselves in women at the top! It is also the men who have to pay the price when the queen (woman) loses. They're being slaughtered in droves. But who's fighting on the good side? Both men and women. It is suddenly okay to have a more balanced distribution between the sexes. The Queen herself? She is transformed into a goat towards the end of the film, but gets to keep her life. Had a man in the same villainous role gotten away with life? The answer we have already received, in the first film about Malificent. Back then, her nemesis was a man. He died at the end of the film, having fallen from a tall building.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

Ok so I’ve watched it excepting something bad as are all of Disney’s live actions and I was surprised as how worse it even managed to be than publicized. How on earth was this produced? Rachel Zegler is an incredibly talented singer but she has no charisma here and most certainly not the looks of the fairest of anything poor thing. What a miscast. The woke philosophy behind her casting could have been tolerable had she been right for the part but she just doesn’t have the looks. I understand that she was named Snow White because of being born on a snowy day and not because of her complexion event though that’s total betrayal to the original tale but there’s no way to make her possibly pass as “the fairest of them all” and certainly not fairer than Gal Gadot who once more shows how stiff and limited her acting skills are. The whole thing has zero soul and even less charisma. Zegler was great in West Side Story but again she doesn’t have the charisma or the looks of a movie star. What an embarrassing waste of budget. The animals and most importantly the dwarfs have no presence and the fact that they used an actual human dwarf to play one of Johnathan’s companions is even more mind boggling. The songs are endlessly generic and nothing stands out. It’s so bad. A pity considering how much this must have cost.,negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

So beautiful history and the idea behind.... Is fantastic but with a base on the real life.. Like those who believe that those who are different from them are the bad ones or those that should not exist when they are the ones that are full of hate...
