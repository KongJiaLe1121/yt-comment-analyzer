"I just watched the movie and I think Snow White was FANTASTIC! The music was incredible, the scenes were beautiful, but what I really enjoyed the most was the simple, pure, good-vs-evil plot where good wins and evil loses. Snow White is a story of how Christ-like leadership--principles of selflessness, virtue, generosity, kindness, compassion, and grace--leads people to prosperity and true happiness. It contrasts this against the darkness of greed and jealously and clearly yet wonderfully teaches that these evil tendencies lead to sadness and spiritual poverty in individuals and nations. In the end, good wins, and evil is consumed by it's own pride. The leader who cares about others and knows their names is chosen by the people. The leader who seeks only for her own interests is destroyed by her greed. This is the type of story I can raise my children on. This is the type of story that makes society better.",negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

"So Disney. Nearly a year out from this trailer. Everyone was correct on how terribly this movie was going to be received. Warner Brothers, one of the most recognizable names in media, is going under. And you, Disney, are on the same track. Are you ready to start making movies people want to watch again? Start hiring artists instead of activists? Stop chasing money and start make things that are going to make you money? Before it's too late and all that legacy is burned down?

"One of my biggest issues with this remake is the weak plot. They had such a huge opportunity to reimagine Snow White for the modern era—especially in a world shaped by filters, cosmetic pressure, and social media. Vanity is already a central theme with the Evil Queen, and they could’ve turned that into a meaningful message about self-worth and identity especially for new young viewers. And Snow White’s original message—like the line “you can fill the world with sunshine”—is more relevant than ever in today’s world full of hate. They really missed a chance to say something powerful.",negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

Watching this movie was such a pain 😭 but I will say the best part about this movie was the music and the CGI was really good in some parts I actually feel bad for the CGI artist because in a lot of scenes the CGI was insanely good it's so sad it was wasted in such a garbage movie what I will say is the best part of this movie was Rachel (surprisingly) her acting and singing was pretty solid for most part except in some scenes she would make the most random faces but for the most part it she was actually good and I do think people tend to forget that prior to her controversy she was literally one of the hottest girls and in this movie shes outshined by most girls that go to private schools it was insane the art department did horrible this movie is a solid 3.5/10 it's horrible like very horrible and this is coming from someone that liked the little mermaid and Aladdin remakes I wouldn't pay to see this movie id actually pay to get hypnotized to forget it 🗑️,negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

So were all other movies made so far.❤ I must say, I am a sinner: listening to the disstracks, laughing while reading the comment section.

Ok so I’ve watched it excepting something bad as are all of Disney’s live actions and I was surprised as how worse it even managed to be than publicized. How on earth was this produced? Rachel Zegler is an incredibly talented singer but she has no charisma here and most certainly not the looks of the fairest of anything poor thing. What a miscast. The woke philosophy behind her casting could have been tolerable had she been right for the part but she just doesn’t have the looks. I understand that she was named Snow White because of being born on a snowy day and not because of her complexion event though that’s total betrayal to the original tale but there’s no way to make her possibly pass as “the fairest of them all” and certainly not fairer than Gal Gadot who once more shows how stiff and limited her acting skills are. The whole thing has zero soul and even less charisma. Zegler was great in West Side Story but again she doesn’t have the charisma or the looks of a movie star. What an embarrassing waste of budget. The animals and most importantly the dwarfs have no presence and the fact that they used an actual human dwarf to play one of Johnathan’s companions is even more mind boggling. The songs are endlessly generic and nothing stands out. It’s so bad. A pity considering how much this must have cost.,negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

Ok so I’ve watched it excepting something bad as are all of Disney’s live actions and I was surprised as how worse it even managed to be than publicized. How on earth was this produced? Rachel Zegler is an incredibly talented singer but she has no charisma here and most certainly not the looks of the fairest of anything poor thing. What a miscast. The woke philosophy behind her casting could have been tolerable had she been right for the part but she just doesn’t have the looks. I understand that she was named Snow White because of being born on a snowy day and not because of her complexion event though that’s total betrayal to the original tale but there’s no way to make her possibly pass as “the fairest of them all” and certainly not fairer than Gal Gadot who once more shows how stiff and limited her acting skills are. The whole thing has zero soul and even less charisma. Zegler was great in West Side Story but again she doesn’t have the charisma or the looks of a movie star. What an embarrassing waste of budget. The animals and most importantly the dwarfs have no presence and the fact that they used an actual human dwarf to play one of Johnathan’s companions is even more mind boggling.

"Congratulations. Really. Bravo to everyone who boycotted Snow White hoping it would fail. You succeeded : the film didn’t do well at the box office. Mission accomplished. But here’s the flip side : Thanks to this failure, many projects that people were genuinely excited about have now been canceled. Aladdin 2 — scrapped. Hercules — suspended during the script phase. Rapunzel — the long-awaited project ? Cancelled. So yes, you got what you wanted. But at what cost ? The irony is that Snow White still found significant success in home media sales. The film is now ranked among the top-selling physical releases worldwide. And those who bought it ? They keep it for life. Unlike a cinema ticket, a DVD doesn’t fade away. So in the end, you made a lot of noise… but for what ? The result : cancelled films, an actress targeted, entire teams demoralized… And a movie that still managed to reach an audience—simply because some people chose to give it a chance. Once again, well done. Truly. 👏",negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

"Avoid! What a monumental disappointment this new adaptation of ""Snow White"" is! Supposedly modern, the film is in reality nothing more than a confused collection of poorly digested ideas. The script, wanting at all costs to correct the tales of the past, falls into the trap of hyper-correction and empties the story of all its poetry and magic. The casting choices, especially for the Queen, cruelly lack the presence and credibility necessary to embody the ""fairest of them all."" The new songs are completely forgettable and break the rhythm of the story instead of enriching it. The visual effects, at times, are painful to watch and sadly recall a low-cost television series. It is a soulless, charmless version that betrays the spirit of the original tale without offering anything worthwhile in exchange.

"Why are people complaining about her being evil? She doesn't seem *evil* to me. She's just an overprotective mother who still has some trust issues when it comes to romantic love because of what happened to her in the first film, and if married Aurora will most likely have to live in the prince's kingdom and away from her. Even so, it looks like she at least tries to support the marriage by meeting with the prince's mom only to have the queen insult her, her kind and motherly abilities, and threatens to take the one person she loves.

"This is a misdirection. The real evil is Aurora's mother-in-law and Maleficent is being overprotective (and her intentions misunderstood). I wouldn't be surprised if the mother-in-law was secretly manipulating things so that Maleficent looks evil (even though she's really not). Prince is likely not in on the deception but a pawn in his mother's scheme. With the introduction of the other ""maleficent"" people, my guess is that the mother-in-law had a part in waging war against them and driving them out, which is why she has issues with Maleficent herself (being 'one of them').",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,2499,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

It is because Maleficent is the one who truly loves Aurora (and it is proven through the true loves kiss seen in the previous movie) and not the Prince. She do not want Aurora to be married to the prince because she’s thinking the possibilities what happened to her before (the fake love thing) might happen the same to Aurora. Ugh!

"Angelina Jolie admitted that she still has the pair of horns at home. Angelina Jolie herself picked Lana Del Rey to sing Sleeping Beauty (1959)'s ""Once Upon a Dream"" for the end credits. Maleficent's magic changes colour. When she is good, her magic is gold and when she is evil, her magic is green. Diaval's make-up (in human form) consisted of ""crow's feet"" on his face and body All the actors and actresses in Maleficent were partly chosen to be in the movie based on their uncanny resemblances and/or likeness to their respective character counterparts in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959). For Maleficent's horns, Angelina Jolie wore several headpieces with different weights. One headpiece was so heavy that Angelina would have neck pains right after and therefore was not appropriate for her more physically intensive scenes, such as her flight and battle scenes. Maleficent is a fairy but notably resembles more of a harpy, the hybrid, winged creature from the Greek and Roman mythologies with the parts of a woman and a bird. The last major film of special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. After this film, he retired from the industry in 2015 due to lack of good work. Maleficent's prosthetics and make-up were inspired by singer Lady Gaga, particularly on her ""Born This Way"" album cover. Angelina Jolie's Disney debut. The film's cast includes one Oscar winner: Angelina Jolie; and two Oscar nominees: Imelda Staunton and Lesley Manville. Pax Jolie-Pitt, Zahara Jolie-Pitt: Angelina Jolie's children appear briefly, cowering in fear of Maleficent during the christening scene. The name ""Maleficent"" is derived from Latin and literally means ""evil doer"". There is no reason given in the film for Maleficent, as a young, good fairy, to have such a name. When she does start to become destructive, the name matches.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"1 year old already! Didn’t seem necessary to make a follow-up but I actually found this one more enjoyable because it builds more of the world Maleficent inhabits, the mythology is much bigger than we thought better action scenes, too and the costume designs are spectacular the choice Maleficent faces here is sticking to protecting those like her or holding onto her humanity with Aurora it's all about aggressive action versus pacifism, uniting a kingdom based on politics vs love, and whether or not wiping out the enemy is best for ruling an entire people there's even a Biblical element towards the end that may feel like a cop-out for most viewers but it comes full circle considering the fairies' rich history if you didn't get enough from that previous movie then this one does try to step it up a bit more",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"I just saw the movie. It was better than I expected, quite a treat 🎃💥🎃. As great as the first one, I'd say. Beautiful and fierce with a strong story line, what can I say. Angie did a great job. The spinning wheel is on this one too, and plays an important role. And YES it is true, Maleficent can turn into a dragon but you got to push her limits to the point of no return. Something we did not see on the first movie. And if you have seen STARDUST (with Pfeifer as witch Lamia) there is an inside joke they used at the end of the movie on Michelle Pfeiffer...lol (you got to see it to find out....)",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"I kinda feel disappointed with this. Many lost their lives to the war, and a lot of things to consider and then Maleficent just turned away with that in an instant and then boom, happy ending. Not to mention the Kingdom massacred the fairies, lock them up in a cathedral as they disappear one by one and then we just got a lighthearted ending. It’s more favorable to me if yes, let’s say Maleficent forgave them (in the blink of an eye lol) but she realized that because of that, humans and fairies can’t really co-exist and she part ways with Aurora for eternity. Idk, because of the plot structure, this should have at least an ending similar to this.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"Are Disney in a woke-war against men? After this film i'm not longer in doubt. I just saw the sequel to ""Maleficent"" with Angelina Jolie. In fact, a Disney movie coined for children. No man has a role of significance in the film. The men who are there must find themselves playing supporting roles; weak, worthless or unconscious (literally, the king lies in a coma through most of the film). Women are the strongest forces, on both sides. The Queen, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, spins a plot so viciously that I think no man could make it up. But who executes her orders? Armies of men. I don't think we'll see an army of women led by a man. But the opposite is obviously not only accepted, but desirable. Also this message is clear; men get to find themselves in women at the top! It is also the men who have to pay the price when the queen (woman) loses. They're being slaughtered in droves. But who's fighting on the good side? Both men and women. It is suddenly okay to have a more balanced distribution between the sexes. The Queen herself? She is transformed into a goat towards the end of the film, but gets to keep her life. Had a man in the same villainous role gotten away with life? The answer we have already received, in the first film about Malificent. Back then, her nemesis was a man. He died at the end of the film, having fallen from a tall building.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"When i saw Maleficent with Dark Fey, i saw the man with white-wings i imagined that Maleficent will fall in love with this white-wings Dark Fey (a man that helped children to learn about how to flying in the air when Malficent in the Dark Fey place). After that, i realized, can Maleficent has her own true love? I mean the real true love of a man. I knew that Aurora is her true love of a child and also find a Prince that really loves her, but come on....... Maleficent should be falling in love again and ended like the Prince & Aurora🤣 This is just my imagination:) I am sorry if my english so worst.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"I seriously doubt that Angelina Jolie would allow her own young kids to see this movie. If she did, they would be scared, and frightened of sleeping alone, so they would want to get in bed with mommy and daddy......oh wait, ""Maleficent"" is their real life mom....so they would probably want to sleep at grandma's house....and years later when they became adults, they would be telling the psychotherapist not only about their mom, but about the evil characters she played in movies that scared them into becoming confused dysfunctional neurotics.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"Judgement Day “But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered in his presence, and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left. “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home. I was naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’ “Then these righteous ones will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing? When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ “And the King will say, ‘I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me!’ “Then the King will turn to those on the left and say, ‘Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons. For I was hungry, and you didn’t feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me a drink. I was a stranger, and you didn’t invite me into your home. I was naked, and you didn’t give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’ “Then they will reply, ‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?’ “And he will answer, ‘I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.’ “And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life.” Matthew 25:31‭-‬46 NLT",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4

"Disney lost a lot of money on this one. No one likes Jolie, or Pfeifer any longer. Neither one are twenty-million-per-movie actresses anymore, either. So, whomever budgeted this movie should be fired. If they wanted this movie to be successful, they should have tried other or better actors.",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4
