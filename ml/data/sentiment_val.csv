"I just watched the movie and I think Snow White was FANTASTIC! The music was incredible, the scenes were beautiful, but what I really enjoyed the most was the simple, pure, good-vs-evil plot where good wins and evil loses. Snow White is a story of how Christ-like leadership--principles of selflessness, virtue, generosity, kindness, compassion, and grace--leads people to prosperity and true happiness. It contrasts this against the darkness of greed and jealously and clearly yet wonderfully teaches that these evil tendencies lead to sadness and spiritual poverty in individuals and nations. In the end, good wins, and evil is consumed by it's own pride. The leader who cares about others and knows their names is chosen by the people. The leader who seeks only for her own interests is destroyed by her greed. This is the type of story I can raise my children on.

"Congratulations. Really. Bravo to everyone who boycotted Snow White hoping it would fail. You succeeded : the film didn’t do well at the box office. Mission accomplished. But here’s the flip side : Thanks to this failure, many projects that people were genuinely excited about have now been canceled. Aladdin 2 — scrapped. Hercules — suspended during the script phase. Rapunzel — the long-awaited project ? Cancelled. So yes, you got what you wanted. But at what cost ? The irony is that Snow White still found significant success in home media sales. The film is now ranked among the top-selling physical releases worldwide. And those who bought it ? They keep it for life. Unlike a cinema ticket, a DVD doesn’t fade away. So in the end, you made a lot of noise… but for what ? The result : cancelled films, an actress targeted, entire teams demoralized… And a movie that still managed to reach an audience—simply because some people chose to give it a chance. Once again, well done. Truly. 👏",negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

Watching this movie was such a pain 😭 but I will say the best part about this movie was the music and the CGI was really good in some parts I actually feel bad for the CGI artist because in a lot of scenes the CGI was insanely good it's so sad it was wasted in such a garbage movie what I will say is the best part of this movie was Rachel (surprisingly) her acting and singing was pretty solid for most part except in some scenes she would make the most random faces but for the most part it she was actually good and I do think people tend to forget that prior to her controversy she was literally one of the hottest girls and in this movie shes outshined by most girls that go to private schools it was insane the art department did horrible this movie is a solid 3.5/10 it's horrible like very horrible and this is coming from someone that liked the little mermaid and Aladdin remakes I wouldn't pay to see this movie id actually pay to get hypnotized to forget it 🗑️,negative,iV46TJKL8cU,0.8,0.15,0.05,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU

"So Disney. Nearly a year out from this trailer. Everyone was correct on how terribly this movie was going to be received. Warner Brothers, one of the most recognizable names in media, is going under. And you, Disney, are on the same track. Are you ready to start making movies people want to watch again? Start hiring artists instead of activists? Stop chasing money and start make things that are going to make you money? Before it's too late and all that legacy is burned down? Because I can write better characters, worldbuilding, and plotlines than anything that you've put out in the last decade. And I'm nobody.

"This is a misdirection. The real evil is Aurora's mother-in-law and Maleficent is being overprotective (and her intentions misunderstood).

Prince is likely not in on the deception but a pawn in his mother's scheme. With the introduction of the other ""maleficent"" people, my guess is that the mother-in-law had a part in waging war against them and driving them out, which is why she has issues with Maleficent herself (being 'one of them').",positive,n0OFH4xpPr4,0.05,0.15,0.8,2499,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0OFH4xpPr4
